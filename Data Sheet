# Datasheet Template
Datasheet for Dataset for NPD forecasting within FMCG industry

## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created?
Ans: This dataset was created to forecast sale volume for a new product launch category X (confidential) for the purposes of this exercise.

- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?
Ans: This dataset was created by the ‘Data and Analytics’ team working for a company A (confidential). All the costs associated with the acquisition of this data as well as processing was funded by company A.
 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?
Ans: Each instance of the data set represents a sales record for a product with values for sales values(float), Sales units (integer), price per unit (float) and distribution values (float)

- How many instances of each type are there? 
Ans: There are 20000 instances within the dataset.

- What does each instance consist of? Raw data? Unprocessed? Text, images?
Ans: Each instance is comprised of records made up of 4 feature values; sales values(float), Sales units (integer), price per unit (float) and distribution values (float)

- Is there any missing data?
Ans: There are occasional missing data (blanks) within the dataset.

- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
Ans: Yes, data is protected by licensing and copyrights laws hence not made publicly available. Data itself is owned by NielsenIQ and Kantar while pre-processed data is bound by confidentiality agreements with company A.

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
Ans: Data was acquired from internal systems of company A who in turn procured it from NielsenIQ and Kantar.

- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
Ans: No, data is not a sample of any larger dataset.

- Over what time frame was the data collected?
Ans: Data was collected over 104 weeks (ending 31st July 2019)

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labelling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
Ans: Not much pre-processing was required to fix the data but we replaced missing values with zeroes for any blank values.

- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the pre-processed/cleaned/labelled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
Ans: No, the raw data for this purposes was acquired from internal systems where it is already saved for future and other uses.

## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for?
Ans: It can also be used for normal sales forecasting and not just for the new products.

- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and pre-processed/cleaned/labelled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
Ans: No, this is a pretty standard datasets that will hard to misinterpret as there are very few sensitive data types included. Only one watch out for the future use of this dataset is that this needs to be used in the context of Country and category. If we take this dataset and apply it forecast for a different category and/or country, the results will not be applicable.

- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
Ans: Using this dataset to design a new product or use this dataset to forecast for a product that is so novel and unique that it is not represented in this dataset.

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
Ans: Dataset is available to all employees of company A and distributed via internal systems.

- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)? 
Ans: Yes, data is protected by licensing and copyrights laws hence not made publicly available. Data itself is owned by NielsenIQ and Kantar while pre-processed data is bound by confidentiality agreements with company A.

## Maintenance
- Who maintains the dataset?
Ans: Original data is maintained by NielsenIQ and provided to company A at a cost and at a regular frequency. Internal IT department for company A is then responsible to maintain it on the internal systems.
